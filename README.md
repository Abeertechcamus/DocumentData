# DocumentData

## Data: 
The file appears to contain 20,008 rows and 19 columns

## Data Cleaning : 
Python (pandas)

## Data Visualization
PowerBI

Here’s an overview of the data structure:

- Row 3 (index 2) has the actual header labels.
- Columns contain various details such as order date, country, city, product category, quantity, unit price, discount, and status.
- Issues include extra headers, missing values, and a lack of consistent column names.

# clean the data
 I’ll clean the data by setting the correct headers, removing empty rows, and renaming columns for clarity.
